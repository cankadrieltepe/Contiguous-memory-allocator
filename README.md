This project involves managing a contiguous region of memory of size MAX where addresses may range from 0...MAX −1. My program responds to four different
requests:
1. Request for a contiguous block of memory
2. Release of a contiguous block of memory
3. Compact unused holes of memory into one single block
4. Report the regions of free and allocated memory
My program is able to work in two different modes, one is the interactive
mode and the other is scripted mode. This project was developed for my Comp304 project.
